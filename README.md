# Nash-Meta-Learning
Official implementation of "Fairness-Aware Meta-Learning via Nash Bargaining." We explore hypergradient conflicts in one-stage meta-learning and their impact on fairness. Our two-stage approach uses Nash bargaining to mitigate conflicts, enhancing fairness and model performance simultaneously.
